## **Description of the project**

Students ‚Äî working in groups ‚Äî are supposed:

1. to familiarize with the [TikTok Trending Videos](https://www.kaggle.com/erikvdven/tiktok-trending-december-2020)
   dataset.
2. to use Python to analyze the above-mentioned dataset and produce three statistical charts that complement an article
   for the printed version of the New York Times on 'what makes TikTok' videos (super-)popular.
3. to produce a companion document that ‚Äî in plain English ‚Äî describes and arguments the design choices behind the three
   statistical charts.

## **Deliverables**

By Nov 16 (5:00 PM) ‚è∞ üí£, students are supposed to submit the following package:

- Python üêç code behind 2.
- a companion document in .pdf format. No word limit applies; however, I really appreciate documents with a high added
  value per page (see the
  bestseller [How to Write Short](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Write-Short-Craft-Times-ebook/dp/B00FOQRPT4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+to+write+short&qid=1634742402&sr=8-1))
  ‚Äì a 10-frame slideshow that summarizes the project (needed if you're selected to present your project to the class).

## **Assessment criteria**

1. appropriate use of notions and frameworks discussed in class.
2. effectiveness of the proposed answer or solution.
3. originality/creativity of the proposed answer or solution.
4. organization and clarity of submitted materials. All criteria carry out the equal weight in terms of marking.

## **Structure of the project**

1. Documents:
    - docs: for some detail information about the code and implementation
    - utils: for some usually used functions or methods
    - data: save the dataset in this file
2. Files:
    - analyze: for analyzing the data to the cleaned data
    - clean: for cleaning the data in the data
